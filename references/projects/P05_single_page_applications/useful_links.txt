DeepLinking and Parameter Passing with React Router.
Here is how UserDetail is created in photoShare.render();
  <Route path="/users/:userId"
    render={ props => <UserDetail {...props} /> }
  />

  from the React Router DOM docs
  docs: https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route/render-func
  Instead of having a new React element created for you using the component prop, 
  you can pass in a function to be called when the location matches.
  The render prop function has access to all the same route props (match, location and history)
  as the component render prop.

  so this.props.match should contain the userId.
  usage: (as in the cs142 SPA slide 10): {match.params.userId}

  Now we can do: userModel(userId);
